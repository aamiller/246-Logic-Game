# Interactive Game

This repository contains code for an interactive web game, created for the [Client-Side Web Development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282) course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://aamiller.github.io/246-Logic-Game/>

Note: The "Make A Level" functionality is not implemented on the hosted version because it includes a very hacky and vulnerable solution, and was only created initially to see if I could find some way to make that feature work at all. If you want to use it, copy down the Development branch, which still includes that feature.
